The **Tree Enumeration Project** is an automated solution that uses machine learning to analyze aerial or satellite imagery for environmental insights. It identifies and counts trees, classifies their types, and calculates the green land and idle land percentages within a given area. This tool is essential for urban planning, deforestation monitoring, and ecological studies. Built using Python, the project integrates image processing, data analysis, and visualization, delivering actionable insights through visual outputs. It offers a scalable and efficient approach to environmental assessment and decision-making.
